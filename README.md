# CakeWorld

CakeWorld in an angular project where we can view list of cakes with their image and name from the api end point, Add new cake with name, comment and yumfactor and on click of any cake it redirects to cake details page where we can see cake details. This project is responsive which can be viwed in mobile, tabs and desktops.

Once downloaded the folder and unzipped on to your system, we will need local server in system to view the project running:
1. If there is xammp or wamp please put the downloaded folder in htdocs folder and open the index.html file with proper url
2. Otherwise open cmd, check for node and npm version. If its not installed please do install node and npm first and type "npm install http-server -g" to gloabally http server, open CakeWorld folder where we have index.html and type http-server in cmd. 
3. Open http://localhost:8080 in web browser, we get the project working.
